Data structures: a data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

Even with the most sophisticated computers and softwares if we don't supply them with the appropriate data types we can hamper their efficiency

We can talk about data-structures in 2 ways:

1. Mathematical/logical models/abstract data types: here we are not bothered about the implementation of the idea for example consider the abstract model of real TV

Abstract model of TV
-Can be turned on/off
-Can recieve signals from satellite
-Can offer audio/video outputs

so here we are not bothered about the physical details we looking at the concept of TV in a abstract, which inculed the features that an abstract object posses

So abstract data types/structures (ADTs) : define data and operations but there will be no implementation

Consider example from coding

List is an example of abstract data type and its features are:
-store a given number of elements of any type
-read elements by position
-modify elements at a position

So the 2 of data-structures is Implementation

2.Implementation: Arrays are the concrete implementation of the abstract idea Lists
